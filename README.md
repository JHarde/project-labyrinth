# Project Labyrinth

A responsive text-based game. :moyai: 

## :brain: Learning objectives
- how to make API calls around Redux using thunks
- how to structure redux store to suit your data
- how to send JSON in the body of a request
- reusable components

## :heavy_check_mark: Features
- responsive page
- using redux to store the current state of the game
- handling of the response
- storing the history of players actions
- showing the descriptions of the directions in the main description of the current room

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Future improvements
- styling every step based on the description
- display a history of all the actions a player has taken
- persist redux store to localStorage, so the app data remains when you reload the page
- drawing a representation of each step the user makes
- have the user input field on a separate page
